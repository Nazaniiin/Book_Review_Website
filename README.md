# My Book Review Website

Web Programming with Python and HTML

In this project I built a Book Review website. I used GoodReads API to pull in the ratings from a broader audience. This project is part of Harvard University's Web Programming course.

In the website:
- Users are able to register for the website
- Users are able to log in to the website using their username and password
- Logged in users can search for books, leave reviews for books, and read reviews made by other people
- Users are able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via my websiteâ€™s API
